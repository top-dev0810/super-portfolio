## üåå The Experience

Imagine zooming through space like a cosmic traveler: Start at our Milky Way galaxy, fly between the stars to reach our solar system, approach Earth, and eventually arrive at my workspace where you can explore my actual portfolio.

This interactive journey works like Google Earth but goes much further - from space to my desk. Move with simple scrolling or swiping gestures.

Why build it this way? Because portfolios should be memorable experiences, not just static pages. Enjoy the journey! üöÄ

## ‚ú® Features

- **Immersive 3D Navigation:**  
  Zoom from the galaxy ‚Üí solar system ‚Üí earth ‚Üí continent ‚Üí city ‚Üí district ‚Üí my studio, all in real-time 3D.

- **Custom GLSL Shaders:**  
  Realistic sun, planets, nebula, and atmospheric effects.

- **Responsive & Mobile-Ready:**  
  Works on desktop and mobile, with different journey endpoints and helpful navigation hints. **Note for iOS users:** Due to WebKit restrictions, interactive HTML elements may work differently on iOS devices.

- **Platform-Specific Experience:**  
  The system detects your device and adapts accordingly. On iOS, the portfolio automatically enters fullscreen mode for better interaction, while on other platforms this remains optional.

- **Performance Optimized:**  
  Asset preloading, scene (shader) precompilation, and post-processing for smooth visuals.

- **Real HTML Portfolio Integration:**  
  My actual portfolio is rendered inside a 3D monitor and phone (depending on what device you're on), fully scrollable and interactive (except IOS).

- **Open Source:**  
  Fork, learn, and contribute! See [ATTRIBUTION.md](./ATTRIBUTION.md) for all credits.

## üå† How It Works

- **Scene Transitions:**  
  Scroll (desktop) or swipe (mobile) to zoom in and out between scenes. Transitions are animated and scenes are precompiled for a smooth experience.

- **3D Models & Textures:**  
  Models are optimized, compressed and converted with [gltfjsx](https://github.com/pmndrs/gltfjsx). Textures are compressed for faster loading.

- **Shaders:**  
  The sun and planets use custom GLSL shaders for a more realistic look.

- **Portfolio in 3D:**  
  My real HTML portfolio is rendered inside a 3D monitor and phone, and you can scroll and interact with it. Depending on which device you are using, you will be shown the corresponding one.

## üèÅ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/top-dev0810/super-portfolio.git
    cd galaxy-portfolio
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Run locally:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

4. **Build for production:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

## üß© Customization

- **Add your own scenes:**  
  Duplicate a scene in `src/scenes/`, update `SCENE_MANAGER` in `src/config/config.tsx`, and wire up transitions.

- **Swap portfolio content:**  
  Edit `public/templates/Portfolio.html` and its CSS.

- **Change models/textures:**  
  Replace files in `src/assets/models/` and `src/assets/img/`. Use [gltfjsx](https://github.com/pmndrs/gltfjsx) to convert `.glb` models to React components (for phone and monitor models).

## üèÜ Additional features
- **Performance first:**  
  Asset preloading, scene precompilation, and postprocessing are all tuned for smoothness.

- **Open and extensible:**  
  Fork, learn, and adapt any part of this project for your own needs.

## üìö Used Sources & Attribution

## üìù Developer Notes

- **Room model optimization:**  
  After every change to the room in Blender, export it with compression and additionally compress the model using gltfjsx before moving it to the project.
  Run this command in your terminal:
  ```bash
  npx gltfjsx room_from_blender.glb --keepnames --transform --resolution=512 --format=png --simplify --instanceall
  ```
  This will optimize and compress your GLB model for best performance.

- **Lightmap baking for optimal performance:**  
  To achieve realistic lighting without the runtime cost of real-time lighting calculations, I used my custom [Blender Batch Lightmap Baker](https://github.com/top/blender-batch-lightmap-baker) script. This tool automates the tedious process of creating and applying lightmaps to 3D models, which significantly reduces render times while maintaining visual quality. For the room scene specifically, baked lighting cut GPU usage by ~40% compared to real-time lighting, giving that smooth 60+ FPS experience even on mid-range devices. The script handles UV unwrapping, material setup, and texture output in one go - saving hours of manual work per model.

- **After changing phone or monitor 3D model:**  
  Re-run `npx gltfjsx <model.glb>` and update the corresponding React component.

- **Modifying the room:**
  The original Blender source files are available in the `/assets-source/blender/` directory. After making changes:
  1. Export as GLB with compression enabled
  2. Run the gltfjsx optimization command

- **Cross-platform HTML integration:**  
  The portfolio includes a special fullscreen mode implementation to handle browser-specific behaviors. Safari on iOS (and by extension all iOS browsers which use WebKit) restricts interaction with embedded HTML content that uses 3D transforms. To maintain consistent functionality across all devices, the system automatically enables fullscreen mode on iOS devices while making it optional on other platforms. This approach ensures visitors can interact with the portfolio content regardless of their device, while maintaining the immersive 3D experience where supported.

- **WebGL2 detection:**  
  The project includes a WebGL2 detection process to ensure compatibility across browsers. This prevents resource-intensive 3D scenes from loading on incompatible devices.

- **Scene precompilation:**  
  The portfolio uses a scene (shader) precompilation system to eliminate frame drops during scene transitions. Instead of the typical approach of preloading assets, this system actually renders all scenes to a 1√ó1 pixel offscreen buffer during loading. This triggers WebGL to compile all shader&material programs before they're needed in the actual scene.

  When you first transition to a new scene in most WebGL applications, there's often a momentary freeze as shaders compile. This is especially noticeable on mobile devices. My precompiler eliminates this by ensuring all GPU programs are ready before you ever see the scene.

  The implementation leverages React portals to temporarily mount components in a virtual scene, forcing the GPU to generate all required shader&materials variants. Once compilation is complete, the scenes remount in the visible scene graph with zero compilation overhead.

  This creates that buttery-smooth navigation experience as you zoom from galaxy to the studio without a single dropped frame.

- **Performance tips:**  
  - Use compressed models (gltfjsx).
  - Keep models low-poly where possible.
  - Test on both desktop and mobile.
